# Become a Builder test from Teamway!

For this project I'll be using Remix:
- [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs)

### State

To handle state I'm using client-server communitication + using the URL to "save state".

For this test we could have also used React with useState and useContext for saving state between page transitions, but I prefer to use the web platform as much as possible. This project works even before any JS is loaded in the client (progressive enhancement).

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```
